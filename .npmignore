# Include everything by default, then re-include generated schemas (they are produced at pack time)
# Start from .gitignore base if desired (but simplest is to explicitly allow)

# Exclude only legacy tmp generated schemas
lib/**/*.zod.tmp.ts

# Ensure aggregator IS published (override any ignore):
!lib/zod-schemas.ts
